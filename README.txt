This simple module allow to have a single sign on for a website network made with domain access and Drupal 7 using different primary domain.

It simple sincronize the sessions so when you will log in into example.com you will be logged in also in example2.com basically getting the cookie throw ajax.

i've also made a version for wesites using varnish and esi (cached pages for auth users).
